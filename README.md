## Introduction

**SOLID Wash Tunnel** is an educational programming series on how to model an automatic wash tunnel with [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles & various [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns). The programming language used throughout the project is C#.

The motivation for this project came after being asked by a friend the question:

> I can understand the GoF design patterns and SOLID principles one-by-one, but fail to understand how to apply multiple of them in a project?

There are countless examples of SOLID & Design patterns around, but most of them use completely different examples for different patterns. I have failed to find an example or project where the author implemented all (or most) of the patterns. 

Nothing is better for a junior/mid level developer than seeing a fully fledged example of the design patterns and their interaction to build a complete project.

**SOLID Wash Tunnel** tries to do exactly that!

During this series we will go over:

* How to create a simple Inversion of Control container.
* How to implement various design patterns and see their interactions.
* Where we adhere to the SOLID principles and where not, and the reasoning behind it.

## Domain

The domain as seen from the title is an automatic vehicle wash tunnel. Customers can send their vehicle to be wash by the tunnel. They use the *UserPanel* to configure various things like:

* Select any of the built-in wash programs, or create a custom program.
* Select whether they are an individual or company customer (They get discounts if they represent a company).
* Receive an invoice at the end in the preferred currency.
